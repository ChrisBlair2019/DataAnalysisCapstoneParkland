## Example Comment

```json
"t1_eggry6n": {
            "body": "I can't believe the largest mass shooting in history, in Nevada, which killed 50 people was quickly forgotten and never brought up again in a major headline. But the kids honoring and fighting for their 17 classmates killed in parkland (considered pretty low for a mass shooting these days) are still making noise and keeping what happened in their school relevant in the media. Those kids deserve some serious props.",
